// 1. Miles-to-Kilometers Converter (Operators):
const kilometers = 1.60934; // • Create a variable named miles and assign a numeric value representing distance in miles.
let miles = 130;
let convert = miles * kilometers; // • Calculate the equivalent distance in kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile =
// 1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
console.log(`The distance of 130 miles is equals to ${convert} kilometers `); // • Use console.log to print a message in the following format:
export {};
// The distance of 130 kms is equal to 209.2142 miles
